              While in College, I was a part of the 
              <span class="highlight">Society of Women Engineers (SWE)</span>. 
              I became the Professional Development Co-Coordinator from 2019 - 2020.
              In this potition, I organized 15 workshops to help develop SWE 
              members in numerous aspects of professional industry. I also organized 
              an annual event that our organization holds annually, known as 
              <span class="highlight">Evening with Industry (EWI)</span> where students 
              get to networking with company recruiters. I was lucky enoguh to even 
              attent a local conference hosted SWE Global.

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
              I have developed several projects that demonstrate a variety of 
              my skills as a Computer Science Major. These projects include: 
            </p>

              <ul>
                <li> 
                  <span class="highlight">This Website! </span>
                  <p>
                    Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the Bootstrap Framework,
                    I was able to create this website 
                    from scratch! This is one of the first websites I made on my 
                    own, so I decided on working on the fundamentels while making 
                    something with a bit of my personality. If you are seeing this, 
                    then this project is a success!

                <li> 
                  <span class="highlight">Artificial Intelligence Classification</span>
                  <p>
                    Using pyhton, a partner and I implemented a system that took in a 
                    data set and use that data to be able to classify items correctly. 
                    The system is able to choose between Forward Selection and Backward
                    Selection to see which algorithm has the best accoracy, and use it
                    to get the best classification of items. 
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li> 
                  <span class="highlight">Graphics Project </span>
                  <p>
                    Using C++, I created a simplified rendering pipeline of multiple triangles
                    and other shaders. This project used concepts including  clipping of shapes, 
                    texture mapping, z-buffering, transformations and homogeneous coordinates.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
            <p>
              These are just a few projects I have worked on. To see more of my projects,

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
              At the moment, I as looking for employment in the field of 
              Computer Science. I am willing and able to take on any job 
              that I am given. However, if I had to choose, the following are 
              the jobs I strive to take:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <span class="highlight">Computer Graphics</span>
                <p>
                  I think it would be awesome to work with 3D models on a porject,
                  whether it be working on graphics for movies, videogame, or for more
                  practical uses, such as developing and testing new technologies. 
                  I am currently building my skills with Blender to make this dream
                  a reality. 
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="highlight">Machine Learning</span>
                <p>
                  AI is on the rise and has made it to the main stream, so more and more
                  people are interacting with it. I would like to make AI more of a tool 
                  for people to use, rather than a tool that takes from people. Entering a 
                  field like this will be a fight for more ethical uses of AI as a tool, 
                  which sounds interesting to me. 
                </p>
              </li>

                <span class="highlight">Web Development</span>
                <p>
                  Designing websites that people will use and interact with fuels that more
                  creative side I have. I think it can be fun to create new ways for 
                  users to interact with a product.
